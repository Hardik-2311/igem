            <div class="overview-p">As longevity increases worldwide, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is becoming more
                prevalent and poses a growing burden on our healthcare systems, both socially and economically. Current
                treatments for AD are mostly ineffectual palliative care. Management of AD is focused on caregiving and
                inclusion, the cost of which is over a trillion USD annually [1]. Particularly in India, where deaths
                due to AD have increased five-folds in the last 30 years, little to no reliable infrastructure exists
                for geriatric care and the anticipated costs are extremely high. Several studies have identified risk
                factors of AD, like levels of education and cardiovascular diseases, that clearly explain the high
                incidence and burden of AD in several Indian states. </div>

            <div class="overview-p">Characterized by an extremely long pre-clinical stage where neuropathological
                changes already begin to occur, studies have approximated nearly 416 million persons on the AD continuum
                [2]. Usually, following a clinical diagnosis, the more definitive tests for AD include expensive medical
                imaging (CT, MRI, etc.) or the invasive quantification of certain biomarker levels in cerebrospinal
                fluid. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a more accessible AD diagnostic tool for vulnerable age
                groups, enabling regular testing. This would help both delay the onset of dementia and foster research
                and development of effective therapeutic tools right during the early stages. </div>
            <div class="cancer"><img src="assests/brain.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%;"></div>


            <div class="overview-p injection-p">The anticipated burden on our healthcare has fostered some urgent
                and important research in the last few years, revealing the presence of salivary biomarkers for AD.
                This could potentially rewrite the scope of early diagnosis and management of AD. Lately, biomarkers
                for several diseases that are otherwise difficult to diagnose are being discovered in easily
                accessible body fluids like saliva, sweat and tears. Research has made significant progress in
                verifying, quantifying, and physiologically explaining the presence of certain biomarkers of AD in
                saliva. The most promising of these are Amyloid Beta and Lactoferrin, with clear specificity for AD
                and p-values 0.001 [3, 4]..
            </div>
            <div class="cancer"><img src="unnamed 1.png" alt=""></div>

            <div class="overview-p">The project we’re developing this year is an aptamer-based diagnostic kit that
                allows rapid and convenient quantification of these biomarkers in saliva, facilitating early detection
                and intervention. We will be synthesizing and optimizing aptamers discovered through SELEX[5] by using
                in-silico methods and tools. The aim is to increase binding affinity of these aptamers and suit them
                more to our specific needs such as effectively identifying the type of heterogeneous pool of Amyloid
                Beta oligomers found in saliva.

            <div class="heading-overview">Alzheimer’s Disease</div>
            <div class="overview-p">Currently, more than 55 million people have dementia worldwide, over 60% of whom
                live in low- and middle- income countries [1]. Deaths due to dementia, after adjusting for old age, are
                estimated to be 1.5 million in 2019 alone [6]. These numbers are set to surge in the coming years with
                increasing longevity and aging populations. Alzheimer’s Disease is the leading cause of progressive
                dementia. India, particularly vulnerable to a lot of AD risk factors and life-style predispositions,
                urgently needs to direct more attention and resources towards the disease. These risk factors, including
                education levels, genetic diversity, rural majorities, cardiovascular diseases, and nutrient
                deficiencies vary disproportionately across the states and strongly correlate with estimated AD patients
                [7].
            </div>
            <div class="cancer"><img src="assests/image2.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="overview-p">The effects of AD are deeply wound into our very social fabric. Neurodegenerative
                disorders have profound effects on the lives of patients as well as their loved ones. Having AD can be a
                deeply alienating experience as it drastically alters social dependencies, understandings, and how we
                relate to each other. For as long as no cure exists, management will rely on improving geriatric care
                and inclusion, posing growing social and economic challenges to our healthcare systems. Early diagnosis
                is crucial for effective management and intervention, and also enables the development of therapeutic
                tools for these preclinical stages.
            </div>
            <div class="cancer"><img src="assests/Group 10.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="overview-p">In India, cultural differences and lack of awareness have been identified as major
                challenges to tackle for the timely management of AD. One of the primary reasons for delayed diagnosis
                and inadequate care for AD is the common tendency to attribute certain symptoms to old age instead of
                dementia. Existing cognitive tests have been designed for English-speaking populations and don’t account
                for socio-cultural differences. The possibility of disintegrating joint-family systems decreasing
                cognitive engagement of the elderly and thus increasing the incidence of dementia is also being studied.
            </div>
            <div class="overview-p">One of the biggest costs of managing AD is that of informal care, i.e. family
                members staying home to support and take care of dependent elderly, and the consequent loss of family
                income. This is particularly high in India due to the lack of trained professionals in managing patients
                with AD and also in general geriatric care. This tends to disproportionately and unfairly affect the
                women in the families who are expected and forced to stay back at home. Thus, there’s an urgent need for
                the development of an easily accessible diagnostic tool, to screen elderly populations regularly for
                timely intervention and better planning of how to care for the patient. </div>

            <div class="overview-p">Lactoferrin is a globular glycoprotein that’s an important component of the innate
                immune system. It’s been detected in various secretory fluids like milk, saliva, tears, and nasal
                secretions. Decreased salivary levels of Lactoferrin (∼ 4.78 ±1.11 µg/mL) have been reported in patients
                with Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, studies have identified a strong correlation (>77%) between decreased
                salivary lactoferrin levels in seemingly healthy patients and their risk of developing Alzheimer’s or
                mild Cognitive Impairment [8].</div>

            <div class="overview-p">Amyloid Beta (Aβ) refers to a group of peptides that are found in extracellular gray
                matter deposits in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s Disease. Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid is used
                in practice as a biomarker and collected through a lumbar puncture. However, as the procedure is
                invasive, recent research has focused on quantifying Aβ42 levels in more easily accessible body fluids
                like saliva. Multiple studies have identified increased salivary levels of Aβ (∼ 127.11 ±33.44 pg/mL) as
                biomarkers for AD with high specificity and sensitivity (AUC in ROC analysis= 0.806) [9].</div>

            <div class="heading-overview">Aptamers</div>
            <div class="overview-p">Aptamers are short oligonucleotide or peptide sequences with high binding affinity
                for particular target molecules. Aptamers are rapidly replacing antibodies and most other target
                recognition systems in biosensors owing to their stability, versatility, sensitivity and inexpensive
                synthesis methods. There has been significant advancement in the development of aptamers against
                Lactoferrin and Amyloid Beta[5]. Most of these are developed through the standard method of in vitro
                selection called Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX). We intend to improve
                the binding affinity of these and particularly target some of our needs, like targeting the type of
                heterogeneous pool of Amyloid Beta oligomers found in saliva. The methods and in-silico tools we’ll be
                using for this are detailed in the next section. </div>

            <div class="overview-p">Aptasensors</div>
            <div class="overview-p">The binding between an aptamer and a target molecule leads to a change in
                conformation of the aptamer structure which can be quantified through various colorimetric, fluorescence
                or electrochemical based techniques[10]. Aptasensors have become a reliable method for diagnosis of
                disease biomarkers as well as environmental pollutants and contaminants. The use of aptamers in Point of
                Care diagnostic kits particularly increased during the pandemic for the detection of SARS-CoV-2[11].
            </div>
            <div class="overview-p">After going through various different aptamer designs, we have chosen an
                electrochemical based signal for our aptasensor. Electrochemical aptasensors, when combined with signal
                amplification techniques[12] can provide an easier way of quantifying the results. These can be
                integrated into a small POC device which measures the electrochemical signal in case of biomarker
                detection and performs signal amplification to provide user interpretable results. A switch-on-off
                electrochemical system can be developed by attaching an electron donating molecule such as ferrocene to
                one end of the aptamer which can then be immobilized on the respective electrode. During the absence of
                the target molecule, the aptamer exists binded to its complementary DNA strand preventing the electron
                donor from coming in contact with the electrode. Thus, no electronic signal is observed and the device
                can be said to be in an off state. Upon exposure to the target molecule, the aptamer instead binds to
                the target molecule, leaving the complementary DNA strand, causing a change in conformation of the
                aptamer-biomarker complex. This allows for the electron donor to come in vicinity of the electrode
                leading to a measurable electronic signal which can be amplified for further inference. This is known as
                a Target Responsive Electrochemical Aptamer Switch. [13]</div>

        <section class="overview" id="aptamers-design">
            <div class="heading-overview">Aptamers Design</div>
            <div class="overview-p">Over the last decade, aptamers have been used in various point-of-care diagnostic
                platforms including Aptamer-Linked Immobilized Sorbent Assay (ALISA), Dot-blot, electrochemiluminescence
                (ECL) assays, fluorescence-based assays, nanoparticle-based assays, lateral flow test strips. Moreover,
                various aptamer-based diagnostic assays have exhibited the potential to follow the WHO's “ASSURED”
                criteria for point-of-care diagnostics: affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, robust, and can
                always be performed outside a laboratory or hospital by unskilled labor.[14]</div>


            <div class="overview-p">Regardless of the intended application, high target affinity is a critical
                requirement of aptamers. However, aptamers with high affinities are not always isolated by conventional
                SELEX. Numerous reports show various techniques for improving affinities of aptamers including the
                optimization of various conditions such as buffer, ions, pH, temperature, and we would like to introduce
                other works for improvement of aptamers apart from these optimization of the environmental conditions.
                Limitation of Binding Affinity in the aptamers identified by SELEX reflect two major procedural flaws in
                SELEX- One is the limitation of molecular diversities in the initial library and the other is the loss
                of potential high affinity aptamers during polymerase chain reaction (PCR).The affinities of aptamers
                can be improved through sequence optimizations, and the understanding of sequence–activity relationships
                of existing aptamers can be used to improve the properties of other aptamers.[15]</div>
            <div class="overview-p">Aptamers fold into unique structures that usually include stems and loops. These
                structures are central to target molecule recognition and any disruptions result in poor binding
                abilities. Some streptavidin binding DNA aptamers that were generated from different libraries by
                different laboratories have the same bulge-hairpin secondary structure motif. Moreover, several
                nucleotides in the loop and bulge, which were critical for binding, were present in all high affinity
                sequences.</div>
            <div class="overview-p">We were able to find the aptamer sequences in the existing literature for our
                selected biomarkers for Alzheimer Disease - Beta Amyloid and Lactoferrin. We established a protocol of
                optimizing the aptamer sequences obtained through in-silico methods which involves utilizing an
                algorithm called MPDR(Mutate Predict Dock Repeat).</div>
